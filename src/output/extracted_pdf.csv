TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TASKFORCE /TECHNICAL WORKING 
COMMITTEE ON THE DESIGN , DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THE TEA INDUSTR Y PRICE STABILIZATION FRAMEWORK  
1. Introduction  
1.1 The tea industry in Kenya is a significant economic activ ity 
in Kenya‘s macro -economy comprising of approximately 650,000 
small -holder farmers and providing direct and indirect employment to 
about 6.5 million workers both at the farm level and at various stages 
of the tea value chain from tea processing at the f actory, 
transportation, warehousing, packing and sale. The tea industry 
contributes about 4% of the country‘s Growth Development Product.  
1.2 In addition, tea is a major export commodity accounting for 
26% of the country‘s total value of exports equivalent to about K Sh. 
130 Billion in export earnings annually. Moreover, Kenya is the world 
leader in the export of black CTC teas and accounts for 22% of total 
global tea exports  
1.3 However, the domestic tea sector has over the recent years 
been facing a myriad of oper ational challenges, key among them 
inefficiencies in the value chain management that poor price discovery 
at the tea auction in Mombasa, cartelization and capture by vested 
commercial interests of the various segments of the tea value chain; 
and low and de clining prices from tea exports  
1.4 The net result of these challenges has been declaration of 
extremely low, declining and often volatile farm -gate prices for tea 
farmers. These low prices have significantly undermined ability of the 
tea sector to sustainably  support quality livelihoods among tea farming 
communities leading to persistent agitations from farmers and their 
leaders for proactive Government intervention in the management of 
the tea value chain with a view to improving earnings.",False,
2021_VOL89.pdf,3,"217 THE KENYA GAZETTE  30th April, 2021  
 1902  1902  
In extreme circums tances, there are instances where farmers have 
uprooted the tea bushes in preference for other horticultural crops that 
are less strangulated by brokers and farmers have more leverage in 
selling their produce  
1.5 From a macro -economic standpoint, the tea secto r is a 
strategic pillar to the Government‘s policy agenda for employment and 
wealth creation. By virtual of the size and the demographic 
characteristics of the populations served and supported by the sector, 
the tea industry is too important a sector to be  allowed to collapse 
under the weight of narrow and predatory commercial interests like 
happened to coffee, tea, cotton, cashew nuts, pyrethrum and other 
hitherto profitable agricultural value chains  
1.6 It is in the context of this background that the Nationa l 
Government has commenced significant tea reforms aimed at 
improving the operational efficiency of the tea value chain in order to 
guarantee better earnings for Kenyan tea at the export market and 
better prices for tea farmers.  
These reforms that inter a lia include optimization of tea handling 
costs by various value chain actors; value addition and 
democratization of the tea handling, storage and trading processes are 
more particularly elaborated in the tea bill 2020 and the Tea Industry 
Regulations, 2020  that are at advanced stages of the legislative process  
2. Establishment of a Tea Price Stabilization Framework.  
2.1  One of the critical reforms envisaged in these two policy   
instruments is the need for development and establishment of a 
sustainable tea  price stabilization framework.  
2.2 Considering the technical and green -field nature of this task, 
it is considered necessary to establish a technical working and advisory 
committee to develop and oversee operationalization of a sustainable 
tea farm -gate price  stabilization framework for the benefit of farmers  
2.3 In general terms, the technical working and advisory 
committee/task force shal l undertake the following tasks — 
(a) develop a robust tea industry price stabilization framework for 
the tea industry in Kenya;  
(b) evaluate the resource requirements and possible sources to 
support the tea industry price stabilization framework;  
(c) consider and evaluate plausible sustainability options for the 
tea industry price stabilization framework; and  
(d) undertake any other task in furt herance of this broad objective  
3. Specific Terms of Reference.  
3.1 The specific terms of reference for the Technical Work ing 
and Advisory Committee/Taskf orce on the tea industry price 
stabilization framework shall be to — 
(a) evaluate available literature on e stablishment of successful 
commodity price stabilization frameworks in progressive and 
comparable jurisdictions;  
(b) based on available and objectively verifiable data and 
information, identify the threats and success factors for 
sustainable commodity price st abilization frameworks in 
comparable markets and jurisdictions;  
(c) based on plausible data and assumptions, identify the threats 
and success factors for establishment of a sustainable tea 
industry farm -gate price stabilization framework in Kenya;  
(d) identify the  critical institutional and technical design 
parameters for a successful and financially sustainable tea 
industry farm -gate price stabilization framework in Kenya;  
(e) identify the financial, technological and human resource 
requirements for the rollout of a t ea industry farm -gate price 
stabilization framework for Kenya;  
(f) using plausible assumptions, evaluate and prioritize on the 
basis of probability of success, the possible sources and 
adequacy of financial resources for a price stabilization 
framework includi ng but not limited to the tea levy proposed 
in the bill, direct exchequer contributions, Donors, Grants,

in the bill, direct exchequer contributions, Donors, Grants, 
bank balances held by KTDA on behalf of farmers in various 
commercial banks accounts, liquidation of non -core farmers‘ 
assets; and other relevant sourc es; (g) define a robust financial sustainability framework that 
include but not limited to sound investment plans and short 
frequency, data supported rebalancing framework for 
resource inflows and outflows in order to guarantee 
sustainability of the tea indust ry farm -gate price stabilization 
framework to perpetuity;

539 the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project. The proponent, Athi Water Works Development Agency (AWWDA), proposes to construct a dam (with a crest elevation of 1800.00 m, a crest width of 8m, a maximum dam height of about 52m, a total crest length of 300m, a controlled drainage area of 67 km2, an effective storage capacity of 16.249 million m3, an average annual water supply of 16.62 million m3, spillway, water intake, bottom outlet and associated facilities), water supply pipeline(diversion pipeline, transmission pipeline, reservoir and associated facilities) and a  water treatment plant  with a capacity of  50,000 m3/d  along River Ndarugo within Thenge-ini area in Kiambu County.        The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures:  Impacts Mitigation Measures Conflicts arising due to loss of land, developments e.g., houses and crops • Compensation of affected persons. • Informing all community members along the pipeline routes of the proposed project. • Incorporating community input. • Creation of a community liaison office.  Loss of vegetation • Retention of vegetation where possible.  • Care will be taken to minimize damage of vegetation cover along the pipeline route. Soil erosion • Loose soils to be used to fill back excavated/disturbed areas. • Loose soils to be compacted with a mechanical roller to avoid erosion by wind or water. Increased generation of waste • Dispose waste at licensed waste treatment sites through licensed waste handles. • Adhere to Waste Management Regulations of 2006. Road traffic disruption • Observe good driving practices to be followed. • Suitable junction/access point to be provided.  • Use of appropriate and legible signage. • Employment of formal flagmen/women to ensure the public safety. Impacts on cultural, religious, and sensitive sites  • Mapping of cultural, religious, and sensitive sites. Rerouting the pipeline to less sensitive sites.  • Consulting the local elders and compensation for any damages caused. Air quality concerns • Limit levels of dust through good practice such as watering of access routes, construction sites, deviations and other disturbed sites and cover lorries transporting construction materials.  • Provide workers with appropriate dust protective gear including masks and overalls. • Regular servicing of vehicles. Noise and vibration • Standard restrictions to hours of site works (8.00 a.m. – 5.00 p.m.) and the fitting of mufflers on construction equipment. •  Use of protective hearing devices such as ear plugs and earmuffs among workers when noise levels exceed 85-90dBA. •  Selection of appropriate machinery and regular servicing of machinery and vehicles. Health and safety risks • Design and implement safety measures Impacts Mitigation Measures and emergency plans to contain accidents risks.  • Install appropriate road traffic signs, markings, and road furniture.  • Provide workers with protective clothing (nose and mouth masks, earmuffs, overalls, industrial boots, and gloves) and helmets. Hydrology • At least 30% of the base flow should always flow in the stream to sustain ecological and social requirements downstream. • Monitor the effects of the dam to the river basin over time. Water loss • Geological profiles proposed for inundation should be established to identify areas of weaknesses and appropriate strengthening measures incorporated. •  Sub-surface water infiltration trends on affected areas should be established and monitored over a period with respect to effects on houses and other structures.  • Plant indigenous trees and shrubs around the dam buffer zone to minimize loss of water through evapotranspiration processes. Increased wastewater production • Ensure that all households, institutions, and businesses connected to the new water pipeline network are also connected to the proposed new municipal sewer line.  • The

wastewater production • Ensure that all households, institutions, and businesses connected to the new water pipeline network are also connected to the proposed new municipal sewer line.  • The wastewater should be treated before being disposed. Climate change impacts  • Integrate climate change impacts such as extreme heat and flooding into the project's design. • Workers be provided with adequate facilities and PPEs to improve comfort in case of extreme heat. • The premises should be constructed with adequate drainage systems to control flooding. • The proponent is advised to construct premises and facilities that can withstand earthquakes (seek further advice from the state department of geology.
