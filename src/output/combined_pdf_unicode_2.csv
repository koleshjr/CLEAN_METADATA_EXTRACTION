Introduction  \n1.1 The tea industry in Kenya is a significant economic activ ity \nin Kenya\u2018s macro -economy comprising of approximately 650,000 \nsmall -holder farmers and providing direct and indirect employment to \nabout 6.5 million workers both at the farm level and at various stages \nof the tea value chain from tea processing at the f actory, \ntransportation, warehousing, packing and sale. The tea industry \ncontributes about 4% of the country\u2018s Growth Development Product.  \n1.2 In addition, tea is a major export commodity accounting for \n26% of the country\u2018s total value of exports equivalent to about K Sh. \n130 Billion in export earnings annually. Moreover, Kenya is the world \nleader in the export of black CTC teas and accounts for 22% of total \nglobal tea exports  \n1.3 However, the domestic tea sector has over the recent years \nbeen facing a myriad of oper ational challenges, key among them \ninefficiencies in the value chain management that poor price discovery \nat the tea auction in Mombasa, cartelization and capture by vested \ncommercial interests of the various segments of the tea value chain; \nand low and de clining prices from tea exports  \n1.4 The net result of these challenges has been declaration of \nextremely low, declining and often volatile farm -gate prices for tea \nfarmers. These low prices have significantly undermined ability of the \ntea sector to sustainably  support quality livelihoods among tea farming \ncommunities leading to persistent agitations from farmers and their \nleaders for proactive Government intervention in the management of \nthe tea value chain with a view to improving earnings."\r\n2021_VOL89.pdf,3,"217 THE KENYA GAZETTE  30th April, 2021  \n 1902  1902  \nIn extreme circums tances, there are instances where farmers have \nuprooted the tea bushes in preference for other horticultural crops that \nare less strangulated by brokers and farmers have more leverage in \nselling their produce  \n1.5 From a macro -economic standpoint, the tea secto r is a \nstrategic pillar to the Government\u2018s policy agenda for employment and \nwealth creation. By virtual of the size and the demographic \ncharacteristics of the populations served and supported by the sector, \nthe tea industry is too important a sector to be  allowed to collapse \nunder the weight of narrow and predatory commercial interests like \nhappened to coffee, tea, cotton, cashew nuts, pyrethrum and other \nhitherto profitable agricultural value chains  \n1.6 It is in the context of this background that the Nationa l \nGovernment has commenced significant tea reforms aimed at \nimproving the operational efficiency of the tea value chain in order to \nguarantee better earnings for Kenyan tea at the export market and \nbetter prices for tea farmers.  \nThese reforms that inter a lia include optimization of tea handling \ncosts by various value chain actors; value addition and \ndemocratization of the tea handling, storage and trading processes are \nmore particularly elaborated in the tea bill 2020 and the Tea Industry \nRegulations, 2020  that are at advanced stages of the legislative process  \n2. Establishment of a Tea Price Stabilization Framework.  \n2.1  One of the critical reforms envisaged in these two policy   \ninstruments is the need for development and establishment of a \nsustainable tea  price stabilization framework.  \n2.2 Considering the technical and green -field nature of this task, \nit is considered necessary to establish a technical working and advisory \ncommittee to develop and oversee operationalization of a sustainable \ntea farm -gate price  stabilization framework for the benefit of farmers  \n2.3 In general terms, the technical working and advisory \ncommittee/task force shal l undertake the following tasks \u2014 \n(a) develop a robust tea industry price stabilization framework for \nthe tea industry in Kenya;  \n(b) evaluate the resource requirements and possible sources to \nsupport the tea industry price stabilization framework;  \n(c) consider and evaluate plausible sustainability options for the \ntea industry price stabilization framework; and  \n(d) undertake any other task in furt herance of this broad objective  \n3. Specific Terms of Reference.  \n3.1 The specific terms of reference for the Technical Work ing \nand Advisory Committee/Taskf orce on the tea industry price \nstabilization framework shall be to \u2014 \n(a) evaluate available literature on e stablishment of successful \ncommodity price stabilization frameworks in progressive and \ncomparable jurisdictions;  \n(b) based on available and objectively verifiable data and \ninformation, identify the threats and success factors for \nsustainable commodity price st abilization frameworks in \ncomparable markets and jurisdictions;  \n(c) based on plausible data and assumptions, identify the threats \nand success factors for establishment of a sustainable tea \nindustry farm -gate price stabilization framework in Kenya;  \n(d) identify the  critical institutional and technical design \nparameters for a successful and financially sustainable tea \nindustry farm -gate price stabilization framework in Kenya;  \n(e) identify the financial, technological and human resource \nrequirements for the rollout of a t ea industry farm -gate price \nstabilization framework for Kenya;  \n(f) using plausible assumptions, evaluate and prioritize on the \nbasis of probability of success, the possible sources and \nadequacy of financial resources for a price stabilization \nframework includi ng but not limited to the tea levy proposed \nin the bill, direct exchequer contributions, Donors, Grants, \nbank balances held by KTDA on behalf of farmers in various\n\nframework includi ng but not limited to the tea levy proposed \nin the bill, direct exchequer contributions, Donors, Grants, \nbank balances held by KTDA on behalf of farmers in various \ncommercial banks accounts, liquidation of non -core farmers\u2018 \nassets; and other relevant sourc es; (g) define a robust financial sustainability framework that \ninclude but not limited to sound investment plans and short \nfrequency, data supported rebalancing framework for \nresource inflows and outflows in order to guarantee \nsustainability of the tea indust ry farm -gate price stabilization \nframework to perpetuity;  \n(h) define a robust risk assessment matrix including appropriate \nrisk triggers and mitigation mechanisms for a sustainable tea \nindustry farm -gate price stabilization framework;  \n(i) develop and oversee an en d-to-end tea industry farm -gate \nprice stabilization framework implementation plan;  \n(j) undertake on -going and end term (post -implementation) \nmonitoring and evaluation of the implementation of tea \nindustry farm -gate price stabilization framework and brief the \nCabinet Secretary accordingly; and  \n(k) undertake any other task in this respect as shall be assigned \nby the Cabinet Secretary.  \n4.
